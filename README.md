# Alternative Logic Set (ALST)
ALST is a computer-aided non-binary logic research, design and simulation system (which can also simulate binary logic). In essence, ALST is a CAD for all imaginable logic systems (binary, ternary, etc) which allows you to create your own basic components, create schemes utilizing those components, and then simulate their behavior with various types of stimuli.

You can easily create interactive systems as well as purely batch-processing ones.
